*  Name:
*     dat1Reopen

*  Purpose:
*     Reopen a file, retaining any existing locators associated with the file

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     hid_t dat1Reopen( hid_t file_id, unsigned int flags, hid_t fapl,
*                       int *status )

*  Arguments:
*     file_id = hid_t (Given)
*        The file_id for the file that is to be re-opened. It should be
*        open on entry to this function.
*     flags = unsigned int (Given)
*        The new file access flags with which to reopen the file.
*     fapl = hid_t (Given)
*        The new file access properties list with which to reopen the file.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Returned function value:
*     The new file_id for the reopened file.

*  Description:
*     Any active locators associated with the supplied file, via any
*     file_id,  are recorded. The file is then closed and re-opened
*     using the supplied access flags and properties list. Any
*     recorded locators are then updated to refer to the new file_id.

*  Notes:
*     - An error is reported if any part of the supplied file is mapped
*     for access on entry.
