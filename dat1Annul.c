*  Name:
*     dat1Annul

*  Purpose:
*     Annul locator without freeing struct memory

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     dat1Annul( HDSLoc *locator, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     locator = HDSLoc * (Given)
*        Locator to free. File resources will be freed but memory
*        associated with the struct will remain valid.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status. Attempts to run even
*        if status is bad.

*  Description:
*     Free up file resources associated with a locator. Cancel the
*     association between a locator and an object.  Any primitive
*     value currently mapped to the locator is automatically unmapped.
*     The C struct itself will be zeroed (except for the version number)
*     and should be freed elsewhere.

*  Authors:
*     TIMJ: Tim Jenness (Cornell)
*     DSB: David S Berry (EAO)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  Notes:
*     - This routine attempts to execute even if status is set on entry,
*     although no further error report will be made if it subsequently
*     fails under these circumstances. In particular, it will fail if
*     the locator supplied is not valid, but this will only be
*     reported if status is set to SAI__OK on entry.
*     - This routine should be called when a locator is being annulled
*     without knowledge of the library user. This happens when the final
*     primary locator is annulled and the secondary locators automatically
*     get released. If datAnnul was called the memory would be freed and
*     a caller might end up with a double free.

*  History:
*     2014-08-26 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version
*     2014-08-29 (TIMJ):
*        datUnmap just in case.
*     2014-10-21 (TIMJ):
*        Try to remove locator from group if we are being asked
*        to free a locator stored in a group.
*     2014-10-30 (TIMJ):
*        Only annul the file_id if it is a primary locator.
*     2014-11-11 (TIMJ):
*        Use new error context. We need to unmap and unregister
*        even if status is bad.
*     2014-11-19 (TIMJ):
*        Cloned from datAnnul
*     2020-07-17 (DSB):
*        Re-written to avoid recursive calls to this function from within
*        hds1UnregLocator.
*     2020-09-11 (DSB):
*        When the last primary locator is annulled, close all HDF5
*        identifiers associated with the file, not just the file identifier
*        in the supplied locator.
