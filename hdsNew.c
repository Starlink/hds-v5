*  Name:
*     hdsNew

*  Purpose:
*     Create new container file

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     int hdsNew( const char *file_str, const char * name_str, const char * type_str,
*                 int ndim, const hdsdim dims[], HDSLoc **locator, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     file = const char * (Given)
*        Container file name. Use DAT__FLEXT (".h5sdf") if no suffix specified.
*     name = const char * (Given)
*        Name of the object in the container.
*     type = const char * (Given)
*        Type of object.  If type matches one of the HDS primitive type names a primitive
*        of that type is created, otherwise the object is assumed to be a structure.
*     ndim = int (Given)
*        Number of dimensions. Use 0 for a scalar. See the Notes for a discussion of
*        arrays of structures.
*     dims = const hdsdim [] (Given)
*        Dimensionality of the object. Should be dimensioned with ndim. The array
*        is not accessed if ndim == 0.
*     locator = HDSLoc ** (Returned)
*        HDS locator of the root element.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     Creates a new HDS container file and returns a locator to the root element.
*     The file is opened with read/write access. If a file with the same
*     name already exists, it will be over-written silently unless it is
*     currently opened within HDS_V5, in which case an error will be
*     reported.

*  Returned Value:
*     int = inherited status on exit. This is for compatibility with the original
*           HDS API.

*     TIMJ: Tim Jenness (Cornell)

*  Notes:
*     - A file extension of DAT__FLEXT (".h5sdf") is the default.
*     - HDF5 file opened with mode H5F_ACC_TRUNC.
*     - HDF5 does not know how to create arrays of structures. When the HDS layer is asked
*     to create a structure array a group (in the HDF5 sense) is created of that name
*     with the string "_STRUCTURE_ARRAY" appended. Inside this group further groups are
*     created named "NAME_1", "NAME_2". Multi-dimensional structure arrays are not
*     supported at this time until a need can be demonstrated. The "locator" returned will
*     be that of the "_STRUCTURE_ARRAY" group and datCell must be used to locate a sub-element.
