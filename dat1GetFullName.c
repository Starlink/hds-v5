*  Name:
*     dat1GetFullName

*  Purpose:
*     Get a buffer with the full name of an object

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     name = dat1GetFullName( hid_t objid, int asfile,
*                             ssize_t * namlen, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     objid = hid_t (Given)
*        Object from which to obtain name/
*     asfile = int (Given)
*        If true obtain the name of the file associated with the
*        object, else obtain the name of the object in the hierarchy.
*     namlen = ssize_t * (Returned)
*        Length of the string in the returned buffer. Can be NULL.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     buffer = char *
*        Dynamically allocated buffer containing a nul-terminated
*        string array of the object name. This will be in standard
*        HDF5 form.

*  Description:
*     Determine the name of the HDF5 object by first allocating a
*     bufffer of the correct length and then filling that buffer
*     with the name.

*  Authors:
*     TIMJ: Tim Jenness (Cornell)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  Notes:
*     - If the returned value is non-NULL, the memory must
*       be released using MEM_FREE.
*     - The name string will be in HDF5 form as returned by
*       H5Fget_name or H5Iget_name.
