*  Name:
*     hdsInfoI

*  Purpose:
*     Retrieve internal state from HDS as integer

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     hdsInfoI(const HDSLoc* loc, const char * topic, const char * extra,
*              int *result, int * status);

*  Arguments:
*     loc = const HDSLoc* (Given)
*        HDS locator, if required by the particular topic. Will be
*        ignored for FILES and LOCATORS topics and can be NULL pointer.
*     topic = const char * (Given)
*        Topic on which information is to be obtained. Allowed values are:
*        - LOCATORS : Return the number of active locators.
*                     Internal root scratch locators are ignored.
*        - ALOCATORS: Returns the number of all active locators, including
*                     scratch space.
*        - FILES : Return the number of open files
*        - VERSION : Return the HDS implementation version number for the
*                    supplied HDS locator.
*     extra = const char * (Given)
*        Extra options to control behaviour. The content depends on
*        the particular TOPIC. See NOTES for more information.
*     result = int* (Returned)
*        Answer to the question.
*     status = int* (Given & Returned)
*        Variable holding the status value. If this variable is not
*        SAI__OK on input, the routine will return without action.
*        If the routine fails to complete, this variable will be
*        set to an appropriate error number.

*  Description:
*     Retrieves integer information associated with the current state
*     of the HDS internals.

*     TIMJ: Tim Jenness (Cornell)

*  Notes:
*     - Can be used to help debug locator leaks.
*     - The "extra" information is used by the following topics:
*       - "LOCATORS", if non-NULL, "extra" can contain a comma
*         separated list of locator paths (upper case, as returned
*         by hdsTrace) that should be included in the count. If any
*         component is preceeded by a '!' all locators starting
*         with that path will be ignored in the count. This can be
*         used to remove parameter locators from the count.
*       - If "!EXTINCTION,EXTINCTION" is requested then they will
*         match everything, since the test is performed on each
*         component separately.
*       - Only valid hds locators are counted. If there is an internal
*         error tracing a locator, it is ignored and that locator is
*         not included in the count.
*    - Top-level scratch locators such as "HDS_SCRATCH.TEMP_N" are not
*      included in the "LOCATORS" count but children of the temp locators
*      are included (since those temporary items should be freed).

*     2014-10-17 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version
*     2017-05-16 (DSB):
*        Add topic VERSION.
