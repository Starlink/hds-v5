*  Name:
*     datUnmap

*  Purpose:
*     Unmap object

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     datUnmap( HDSLoc * locator, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     locator = HDSLoc * (Given and Returned)
*        Primitive locator. Previously mapped with datMap or related
*        routine.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     Unmap an object mapped by another datX routine.

*  Authors:
*     TIMJ: Tim Jenness (Cornell)
*     {enter_new_authors_here}

*  Notes:
*     - If status is bad on entry an attempt will be made to sync
*       data back to the file and resources freed, but the sync is
*       not guaranteed (depending on the reason the status was bad).
*     - API differs slightly from HDS in that the supplied
*       locator can not be const as its state is updated.

*  History:
*     2014-08-29 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version
*     2014-11-06 (TIMJ):
*        If pointer was memory mapped directly from a file close
*        the file and do not use datPut.
*     2014-11-20 (TIMJ):
*        Use cnfFree if the pointer was not actually mapped.
