*  Name:
*     dat1Type

*  Purpose:
*     Enquire the type of an object (enum version)

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     hdstype_t dat1Type( const HDSLoc *locator, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     locator = const HDSLoc * (Given)
*        Object locator
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Returned Value:
*     type = hdstype_t
*        Enum indicating the HDS type associated with this
*        locator. Returns HDSTYPE_NONE on error.

*  Description:
*     Enquire the type of an object and returns that type as an enum.
*     use datType() to return a string form that will also return types
*     of structures and details of string length.
