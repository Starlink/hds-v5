*  Name:
*     dat1Handle

*  Purpose:
*     Find a handle structure that describes a component of an HDF object.

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     Handle *dat1Handle( const HDSLoc *parent, const char *name,
*                         int rdonly, int *status );

*  Arguments:
*     parent = const HDSLoc * (Given)
*        Pointer to a locator for the HDF object that contains the
*        required  component. This may be NULL if the required component
*        has no parent (i.e. the 'component' is actually a top level object).
*     name = const char * (Given)
*        The name of the HDF component within "parent" to which the
*        returned Handle should refer. It is assumed that the named
*        component does in fact exist within the parent object, although
*        this is not checked. If "parent" is NULL, the path to the
*        container file should be supplied.
*     rdonly = int (Given)
*        If a new Handle is created as a result of calling this function,
*        it is locked for use by the current thread. If "parent" is
*        non-NULL, the type of lock (read-only or read-write) is copied
*        from the parent. If "parent" is NULL, the type of lock is
*        specified by the "rdonly" argument. The supplied "rdonly" value
*        is ignored if "parent" is non-NULL or if a pointer to an existing
*        handle is returned.
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Returned function value:
*     Pointer to the Handle structure for the name component. A NULL
*     value will be returned if an error occurs.

*  Description:
*     A Handle structure contains information about a specific HDF object
*     (group or dataset) that is constant for all locators. Any one
*     HDF object can have multiple locators that refer to it. Each HDF
*     object that has been accessed by HDS will have one (and only one)
*     Handle structure associated with it, which contains information
*     specific to the HDF object that is shared by all locators that
*     refer to the object.

*  Notes:
*     - NULL will be returned if an error has already occurred, or if
*     this function fails for any reason.
